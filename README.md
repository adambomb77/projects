## Project 22
- Download the "project22" file
- Use `localstorage` to create a TODO app that will save all input to the device
- If the `localstorage` has values already, they should populate when the page loads (closing the window and reopening retains the "todo's")
- If an item already exists in the list, show a console message noting the duplicate
- User should be able to add and remove items and have the changes save automatically
- Some javascript/jQuery methods you will need:
  - [$.inArray](http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/)
  - [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify)
  - [JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse)
  - [splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice)
